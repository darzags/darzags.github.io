This involved coordinating with leadership to formalize how BSDS delivers daily situational data (such as safe room presence, building codes in effect, HHPD dam proximity, and critical facilities) during post-disaster activations. I automated key components of the data-gathering process, integrating sources like weather.gov, Hazus, HIFLD, and internal building code tracking datasets. The resulting SOP not only improved turnaround times but also ensured consistent, actionable reporting in fast-paced disaster environments."
